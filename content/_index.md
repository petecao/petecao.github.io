      title: '🖥️ My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm a research scientist in the Compilers Creating Custom Processors (CCCP) group at the University of Michigan in the Computer Engineering Lab advised under Prof. Scott Mahlke. I also work closely with Prof. Reetuparna Das. My goals are to combine my knowledge with compilers and computer architectures to make things go *zoom*.

        I am currently working on a collaboration with Los Alamos National Lab for accelerating their HPC applications. My current focus is on speeding up codes with indirect accesses by improving memory accesses. My current approach is exploring compiler optimizations that increase spatial locality.

        In the future, I intend to explore these techniques and how they can be extended to other applications, such as adaptive mesh refinement or in sparse LLM inference.
